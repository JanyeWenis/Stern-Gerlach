This is a simulation of the famous Stern-Gerlach experiment made using the SeQUeNCe framework in python. 
https://github.com/sequence-toolbox/SeQUeNCe is the repo link to the framework.
This is a very low-level program that can be configured in a modular way. all attributes of the components are configurable inside the function that they are initialised in.
There is some error in the code that executes the event 4 times that I shall fix in the future
